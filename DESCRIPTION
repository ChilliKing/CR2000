Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Marco",
           family = "Surace",

Description: Given a list of names, and if desired pairs that you do not want to be generated, this package
    randomly pairs the names so that everyone has a partner, and no name appears more than once. It then writes 
    out the pairs, and adds the pairs which have been generated to a list of unwanted pairs.
